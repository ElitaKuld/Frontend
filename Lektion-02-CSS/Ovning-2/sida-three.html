      Kingfishers are a family, the Alcedinidae, of small to medium-sized,
      brightly colored birds in the order Coraciiformes. They have a
      cosmopolitan distribution, with most species found in the tropical regions
      of Africa, Asia, and Oceania, but also can be seen in Europe. They can be
      found in deep forests near calm ponds and small rivers. The family
      contains 116 species and is divided into three subfamilies and 19 genera.
      All kingfishers have large heads, long, sharp, pointed bills, short legs,
      and stubby tails. Most species have bright plumage with only small
      differences between the sexes. Most species are tropical in distribution,
      and a slight majority are found only in forests.
